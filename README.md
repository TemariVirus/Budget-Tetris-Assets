# Budget-Tetris-Assets

Assets used to develop [Budget Tetris](https://github.com/TemariVirus/Budget-Tetris).

## BGM

The BGM was created using [Modbox](https://moddedbeepbox.github.io/3.0). The song data can be found in `sounds/modbox/bgm.json`.

To compress the song, it was exported as 3 separate WAV files, corresponding to channels 1 & 2 (bgm-1.wav), channel 3 (bgm-2.wav), and channel 5 (bgm-3.wav). These files were then converted to 8-bit mono audio and compressed with xz on the highest setting. The final result is only 26KiB (4.32Kib/s).
